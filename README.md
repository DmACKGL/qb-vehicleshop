# qb-vehicleshop
Vehicle Shop for QB-Core Framework :car:

## Changes by BrianTU#0001
This was modified for my personal server. This does not provide all the features found in the base qb-core vehicleshop, so if you are looking for some features rename this resource and use it together.

### Features
- Blacklisted vehicles,
- Limited quantity vehicles,
- Price discount list,
- Optional Blips,
- [E], Boxzone and Ped support,
- Showroom vehicles,
- Target job restriction,

### Fixes & Backend
- Database issues,
- Recoded config to support changes
- UI information does not remain from last shop,
- Recoded UI to reflect money correctly,
- Recoded UI scroll to reduce/eliminate scroll lag,
- Reconfigured UI to use manufacturer logo's,
- Included 320+ real manufacturer logo's,

### Current bugs
- You may experiance UI lag when scrolling. My fix is not a 100% fix, however there is better scrolling moments than there is bad.
